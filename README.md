# ComparativePoliticsResearchProjects

Open space to discuss possible research projects in comparative politics... code will also be provided when possible

# CASE STUDY ONE - "If I got the question right: Does the performance* and concentration of citizens in an industries at the ----- level affect voting outcomes?" 

Related Questions: How do we account for ideological/party leans that may exist in some industries ~ Non-renewable Energy (leaning Republican), Agriculture (assume lean to the right), Renewables (assume lean to the left), Auto (assume lean to the left), etc.

# Mechanisms to consider - 
	There maybe a relationship between education and industry.
	For instance, manufacturing requires 12th Grade (+ Job Training?), whereas Pharmaceutical Industry requires a min. of a college 		     degree in a pharmacology or chemistry. Not to mention within industry variation of educational attainment.
	
	Racial and Gender Component: 
	Is diversity within an industry such as information technology based on geographic endowments? By how much is that a factor?
	Furthermore, even if geography is irrelevant, what about the relationship of education, race and gender/sex?
	
# Dependent Variable: 
	Vote-Participation = sum(votes_per_candidate)/eligible_voters

# Primary Variable of Interest:
  An industry fractionalization score? 

# Variables to include arranged by Level of Analysis
# Tract (some of these variables can be found at other scopes)
		Ownership vs Rental 
		Race
		Education (level) (PERDUCA)
		Gender
		Gender workforce
		Race workforce
		Age
		Income
		Percent-In-Poverty
		(By Gender) - Travel Time
		(By Gender) - Aggregate Travel Time
		Transportation (By Gender)
		
# City/Town/Sub-county
		Urban/Rural (Binary)
		Major-Industry
    		Industry-Specific Tax cuts
    		Other Subsidies
		Public Investments
		
		# Variable that looks at the proportion of jobs that work for exporting (out of place) vs support jobs.
				
# County	
		Democratic/Republican/Indep Last Election(Multinomial)
		Democratic/Republican/Indep Election Committee

# Congressional District
    		Industry Specific Earmarks
		
    
# State	
		Jim Crow Laws (Binary)
		Ex-convict Laws (Binary)
 
# Possible Methods of Analysis:
  This requires us to utilize a multilevel general linear model.
